Battle #2
=========

The careful assasin has been slightly altered to be a little more bloody

```js
module.exports = function (gameData, helpers) {
  // kill when possible

  var nearbyEnemy = helpers.getNearbyWeakestEnemy(gameData);

  if (nearbyEnemy && nearbyEnemy.tile.health < 30) {
    return nearbyEnemy.direction;
  }

  // act as a careful assassin
  ...
};
```

That has a litle impact but I think is better than the default careful assasin on the long run

The good
--------

*   We won!
*   I killed an enemy!

The bad
-------

*   I has been killed
*   killed at turn #287
*   killed by a **safe diamond miner**

Notes
-----

### There is no "I" in team

My first approach was to focus on average kills leatherboard.

While I think this is a good approach to be focused on, the *real* target needs to be to achieve the most team wins, as
this is the target of the game:

>   "The yellow king and the blue king are at war! Your JavaScript skills are needed to determine the victory"

So, even if I try to get the victory by improving my killing skills I want to consider the overall team health too

>   "Moving into a friendly hero will heal that hero for 40 health. Remember, there is no *I* in team."

One question raises here: Can a hero get more than 100 health points?

Until I find the answer I will assume it is not. In practice that means I will heal nearby teammates if they have
`health <= 60`

**Verified: heroes can't get more than 100 health points**

That will lead to enemies changing its target to me in some cases, being counterproductive if the teammate's AI is worse
than mine. So maybe is better to heal nearby teammates if they have `health < (myHero.health - 40)`

### Corners are strategic positions

What I have seen so far is that while items in the board are different between combats, the board is always surrounded
by non accessible tiles in the board's perimeter (assuming that trees are non accessible tiles)

Also I have seen that there are 2 different corner layouts:

1.  Health well, Tree, Health well
2.  Health well, Tree, Diamon mine

Where in both cases, the tree is just in the corner with a health well or a diamond mine in its adjacent tiles

If a hero is placed in the accessible corner tile of the 2nd corner layout, he has a health well and a diamond mine as
adjacent tiles which is a good position because he needs 2 enemies to kill him (see "avoid the healing enemy" of
`battle-20141011.md`) and also he can benefit his team by earning diamonds each turn

Default hero AIs **safe diamond miner** and **selfish diamond miner** can be trapped in the 2nd corner
layout if they have an adjacent enemy:

```js
// Heal if you aren't full health and are close to a health well already
if (myHero.health < 100 && distanceToHealthWell === 1) { return directionToHealthWell; }
```

**Cowards** are always trapped in a tile with an adjacent health well, so they need 2 enemies to kill him:

```js
return helpers.findNearestHealthWell(gameData);
```

### Support teammates fighting healing enemies

Since a healing enemy needs to heroes to kill him, if you find a teammate fighting a healing enemy go to support him

If there is no teammate in this kind of fight avoid the healing enemy as usual

### The paladin

A mix of **priest** and **careful assasin**. It tries to heal teammates while keeping himself healthy, but if he has a
chance to kill, he does

### Fix pathfinder algorithm

I have seen that a **safe diamond miner** hero is trapped in a wall of trees while having `health: 100`

This raises a question: Does the pathfinder algorithm ignore trees?

Also, this verifies that **trees are non accessible tiles**

The **safe diamond miner** uses the `findNearestNonTeamDiamondMine()` helper to choose a path if he is healthy

```js
/**
 * findNearestNonTeamDiamondMine()
 *
 * Returns the direction of the nearest non-team diamond mine or false, if there are no diamond mines
 */
 
var findNearestNonTeamDiamondMine = function (gameData) {
  var hero = gameData.activeHero;
  var board = gameData.board;

  // Get the path info object
  
  var pathInfoObject = findNearestObjectDirectionAndDistance(board, hero, function (mineTile) {
    if (mineTile.type === 'DiamondMine') {
      if (mineTile.owner) { return mineTile.owner.team !== hero.team; }
      return true;
    }
    
    return false;
  });

  // Return the direction that needs to be taken to achieve the goal
  return pathInfoObject.direction;
};
```

Since the subject under study had nearby diamond mines owned by his enemies, I assume that the
`findNearestObjectDirectionAndDistance()` pathfinder algorithm does ignore trees

This must be fixed as soon as possible

### Turn and enemy counters

I don't know what kind of information is provided by the game engine yet. Meanwhile I could keep a count of the
number of turns my hero has played (through a closure) and the enemies alive (through a board scan) and modify the
behavior based on that statistics. This could be an improvement over the random behavior exposed in **the hunter**
(`battle-20141011.md`)

### The hunter: first approach

Fight against the safe diamond miner

The most common behavior is the **safe diamond miner** as it is the behavior exposed by default in the hero-starter
repo provided by the game developers. In fact, most of the users doesn't have modified the cloned repo at all

1.  Go to the nearest diamond mine in the perimeter which is owned by a teammate or not owned by anybody
    
    The target mine needs to have the following layout (which is common in the game as far as I know)

        Health well, Tree, Diamond Mine, Health Well
        
    It doesn't matter if the exposed layout is in reverse order or in a vertical position

2.  Capture the mine if is not owned by a teammate
3.  Go to the nearest health well
4.  Wait until a **safe diamond miner** fall into the trap while healing yourself
5.  Assuming that the target was totally healthy, he will die after a chase of 2 movements
    
    So, if a adjacent tile has a distance of 1 from your position, when you are at a distance of 3 of your waiting
    tile you must give up the chase (the target has died or something unexpected has happened)

6.  Heal yourself until you are healthy and repeat the process

### Tile data

The following data is provided by the `getTileNearBy()` helper

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "distanceFromTop": 3,
  "distanceFromLeft": 3,
  "minesOwned": {},
  "mineCount": 0,
  "minesCaptured": 0,
  "health": 80,
  "dead": false,
  "diamondsEarned": 0,
  "damageDone": 30,
  "heroesKilled": [],
  "lastActiveTurn": 13,
  "gravesRobbed": 0,
  "healthRecovered": 0,
  "healthGiven": 0,
  "won": false,
  "type": "Hero",
  "subType": "Adventurer",
  "team": 1,
  "name": "Enemy"
}
```
