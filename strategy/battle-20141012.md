Battle #2
=========

The careful assasin has been slightly altered to be a little more bloody

```js
module.exports = function (gameData, helpers) {
  // kill when possible

  var nearbyEnemy = helpers.getNearbyWeakestEnemy(gameData);

  if (nearbyEnemy && nearbyEnemy.tile.health < 30) {
    return nearbyEnemy.direction;
  }

  // act as a careful assassin
  ...
};
```

That has a litle impact but I think is better than the default careful assasin on the long run

The god
-------

*   We won!
*   I killed an enemy!

The bad
-------

*   I has been killed

### There is no "I" in team

My first approach was to focus on average kills leatherboard.

While I think this is a good approach to be focused on, the *real* target needs to be to achieve the most team wins, as
this is the target of the game:

>   "The yellow king and the blue king are at war! Your JavaScript skills are needed to determine the victory"

So, even if I try to get the victory by improving my killing skills I want to consider the overall team health too

>   "Moving into a friendly hero will heal that hero for 40 health. Remember, there is no *I* in team."

One question raises here: Can a hero get more than 100 health points?

Until I find the answer I will assume it is not. In practice that means I will heal nearby teammates if they have
`health <= 60`

**Verified: heroes can't get more than 100 health points**

That will lead to enemies changing its target to me in some cases being counterproductive if the teammate's AI is worse
than mine so maybe is better to heal nearby teammates if they have `health < (myHero.health - 40)`
