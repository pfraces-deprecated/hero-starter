Battle #3
=========

**The paladin** has born

```js
/**
 * Paladin
 *
 * A mix of priest and careful assasin
 *
 * It tries to heal teammates while keeping himself healthy, but if he has a
 * chance to kill, he does
 */

var paladin = function (gameData, helpers) {
  var myHero = gameData.activeHero;

  // keep yourself healthy

  if (myHero.health <= 60) { return helpers.findNearestHealthWell(gameData); }

  // kill affordable enemies

  var adjacentEnemy = helpers.getAdjacentWeakestEnemy(gameData);

  if (adjacentEnemy && adjacentEnemy.tile.health < 30) {
    return adjacentEnemy.direction;
  }

  // heal affordable team members

  var adjacentTeamMember = helpers.getAdjacentWeakestTeamMember(gameData);

  if (adjacentTeamMember &&
      adjacentTeamMember.tile.health < (myHero.health - 40)) {
    return adjacentTeamMember.direction;
  }

  // default to careful assassin

  return helpers.findNearestWeakerEnemy(gameData);
};
```

Here I have priorized to be healthy due to the fast death in the previous battle (turn #287) killed by a
**safe diamond miner**

The good
--------

*   We win!
*   I have survived!
*   I kill 4 enemies!

The bad
-------

*   Does not supported a fight against healing enemy
*   Get trapped by mine or health well

Notes
-----

### A hero dies with `health: 0`

I was wrong assuming that a hero is dead with `health < 0`

Some algorithms needs to be tweaked here

### A health well gives 30 life points

I have a bug, where I'm going to heal myself with `health <= 60` where it needs to be
`health <= 70` although maybe this is too high health to approach
