Thoughts from the 1st battle (October, 11 2014)
===============================================

I have chosen the **Careful assasin** as starting point

```js
/**
 * Careful Assassin
 * 
 * This hero will attempt to kill the closest weaker enemy hero.
 */

module.exports = function (gameData, helpers) {
  var myHero = gameData.activeHero;
  if (myHero.health < 50) { return helpers.findNearestHealthWell(gameData); }
  return helpers.findNearestWeakerEnemy(gameData);
};
```

The good
--------

*   We won!
*   Hero survived!

The bad
-------

*   Hero didn't kill
*   Trying to kill an enemy while he is using a health well is useless. You earn damage points but didn't kill him since
    your damage (10 + 20) is equal to the healing well recovery (30). Meanwhile he is doing 20 damage to you
