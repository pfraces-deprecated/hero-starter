Battle #1
=========

I have chosen the **Careful assasin** as starting point

```js
/**
 * Careful Assassin
 * 
 * This hero will attempt to kill the closest weaker enemy hero.
 */

module.exports = function (gameData, helpers) {
  var myHero = gameData.activeHero;
  if (myHero.health < 50) { return helpers.findNearestHealthWell(gameData); }
  return helpers.findNearestWeakerEnemy(gameData);
};
```

The good
--------

*   We won!
*   Hero survived!

The bad
-------

*   Hero didn't kill

Observations
------------

### An enemy with `health 0` still alive

Remember: **If a hero's health drops below 0, it will die.**

### Initiatives

The heroes move according to its battle id, so the id 0 move first, id 1 move second and so on

### Heal for free

Healing a team mate by moving to him (`health + 40`) doesn't reduce own's health

### Avoid the healing enemy

Trying to kill an enemy while he is using a health well is useless. You earn damage points but didn't kill him since
your damage (`10 + 20`) is equal to the healing well recovery (`30`). Meanwhile he is doing `damage 20` to you

### Silent death

You can kill an enemy with `health < 40` which isn't near a health well in 2 moves:

1.  First go near him in one move (`damage 20`)
    *   The enemy (now with `health < 20`) probably tries to find a health well
2.  Go near him again (`damage 20`)
    *   Even if he has found a health well he doesn't have time to heal himself

Since you can kill an enemy near you with `health < 30` by moving to him (`damage: 10 + 20`), it is probable that some 
AIs look for heal themselves when its `health < 30`

So if your hero is near an enemy with `health: 50` it could be better to just `Stay` doing `damage: 20` instead of
moving against him and do `damage: 10 + 20`

### The hunter

**The hunter** is a hero class that will recognize default heroes patterns and fight against them by applying known
techniques that will benefit for their weaknesses

In order to avoid that kind of heroe, it may be interesting to apply some random movement when there are no good options
